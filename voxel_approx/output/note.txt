This directory txt_ft_files is the result of the voxel-voxel contact finder: scanStackRangeContact.pl. If two particles are determined to have adjacent voxels, they are recorded.

The format is:
<unit vector: x,y,z> distance

where the unit vector is between the centroids of two adjacent particles and distance is the distance between the two centroids.
